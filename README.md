# CSS for JS Workshops

My solutions to all the workshops from [CSS for JavaScript Developers
course](https://css-for-js.dev/).

Workshops are real-world-inspired problems presented in each module. The project
and its goals are described in depth in the project's README.md file.

1. Rendering Logic I - Huckleberry
2. Rendering Logic II - Character Creator
3. Modern Component Architecture - Mini Component Library
4. Flexbox - Sole&Ankle I
5. Responsive and Behavioural CSS - Sole&Ankle II
6. Typography and Images - Unsprinkle
7. CSS Grid - New Grid Times
8. Animations - Sole&Ankle III

Obs.: A workshop without a link means that I haven't solved it yet ðŸ‘€
