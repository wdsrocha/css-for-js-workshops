[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/423b7749-06f9-4ec8-950d-a8611a55ff67/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/wdsrocha-css-for-js/deploys)

My solutions to all the workshops from [CSS for JavaScript Developers
course](https://css-for-js.dev/).

Workshops are real-world-inspired problems presented in each module. The project
and its goals are described in depth in the project's README.md file.

1. [Rendering Logic I](01-rendering-logic-i/)
2. Rendering Logic II
3. Modern Component Architecture
4. Flexbox
5. Responsive and Behavioural CSS
6. Typography and Images
7. CSS Grid
8. Animations

Obs.: A workshop without a link means that I haven't solved it yet ðŸ‘€
